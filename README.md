Artemis Financial is a company that helps clients plan for things like savings, retirement, and investments. They wanted me to make sure their software was safe and that all the data moving between users and the system was protected. Their main issue was that the code needed stronger security and encryption to keep private information safe.

When I reviewed their system, I did well at catching weak spots in the code and explaining what needed to change. Secure coding matters because one small mistake can open the door for hackers. When software is protected, it builds trust and keeps both the company and its clients safe.

The most challenging part was sorting through all the reports and learning what each warning actually meant. It was also helpful because it taught me how different tools detect issues. I added more security layers by using encryption, checking certificates, and updating old libraries. In the future, I’d use tools like OWASP Dependency-Check, CVE lists, and regular code reviews to keep everything safe.

To make sure the code stayed functional, I ran the program after every change and tested the features. After refactoring, I scanned the code again to confirm no new weaknesses showed up.

Some tools that really helped were Eclipse, Maven, and the dependency-check plug-in. These will definitely be useful in future projects. If I were to show this work to an employer, I’d highlight how I took a real-world project, found vulnerabilities, and turned it into a secure and working solution that protects user data.
